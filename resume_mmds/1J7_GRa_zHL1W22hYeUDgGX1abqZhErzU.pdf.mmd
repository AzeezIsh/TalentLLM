\section*{Experience}

Georgia Tech | Atlanta, GA

RISC-V Processor Design + Tapeout

Aug 2023-May 2024

- Design and verification of an SoC including RISC-V processor, UART, SPI, CORDIC modules, using $65 \mathrm{~nm}$ TSMC PDK.

- Theory, design, verification, test of fabricated synchronous CMOS digital circuit. Using synthesis, autoplace and route (SAPR) as industry standard tools. Contributed to Apollo program in 1960.

Tektronix Inc. | Beaverton, OR

Applications Engineering Intern

Jun-Aug 2023

- Researched and validated a framework (using mmWave FMCW + CNNs) for federated learning on beam prediction using low power devices (Nvidia Jetson) for test + measurement.

- Optimized training routine (in PyTorch) to accommodate resource constrained devices, enabling inspection of model performance relating to different layer types, using GPU acceleration (CUDA + TensorRT).

- Identified possible solutions to improve model accuracy and performance, increasing model metrics by $5-10 \%$ with $20 \%$ smaller memory footprint. Received presidential medal of honor for work on machine learning development.

- Helped pitch solution for object tracking using Bispectral NNs (Sanborn, 2023), flexible replacement over conventional FFT.

Yousefi Lab @ WPI | Worcester, MA

Reinforcement Learning and Data Pipeline Researcher

Jun-Aug 2022

- Researched and validated a reinforcement learning model that fit design requirements, assisted in its development using TensorFlow, producing a proof-of-concept.

- Orchestrated development of a data pipeline using GCP tools (Pub/Sub, Dataflow, BigQuery, Vertex AI) to ingest, preprocess, and store neural data for training and running inference on a developed RL model, demonstrating scalability.

Shoptaki Inc. I New York City, NY (Remote)

Aug 2021 - Aug 2022

Fullstack Engineer (Began as SWE Intern)

- Led full-stack (frontend + backend) development of a demo website for newcomers in data science, using ReactJS, Flask, Express, and Arango DB.

- Implemented CD pipelines in various development workflows using GitHub Actions and GCP Cloud Run/Build, reducing errors in manual deployment to $<5 \%$ of deployments.

- Assisted cloud migration of various AWS services to GCP with minimal impact on service or user experience.
